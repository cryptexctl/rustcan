# Implementation Guide

## Service Detection

### Basic Service Detection
The basic service detection module provides fundamental protocol identification and version detection for common services. It uses a combination of:
- Protocol-specific probes
- Regular expression patterns
- Response analysis

### Enhanced Service Detection
The enhanced service detection mode provides:
- More detailed version information
- Additional protocol support
- Operating system detection
- Product identification
- Vulnerability scanning

### Vulnerability Scanning
The vulnerability scanning feature:
- Checks for known CVE patterns
- Identifies outdated versions
- Detects common misconfigurations
- Provides vulnerability descriptions

### Service Patterns
Each service pattern includes:
- Protocol name
- Regular expression for identification
- Probe data
- Version detection patterns
- Product detection patterns
- OS detection patterns
- Vulnerability patterns

### Example Usage

Basic scan:
```bash
rustcan --target 192.168.1.1 --service-detection
```

Enhanced scan with vulnerability detection:
```bash
rustcan --target 192.168.1.1 --service-detection --enhanced
```

### Output Format

Basic output:
```
[+] 192.168.1.1:22 is open
    Service: SSH
    Version: 2.0
    Product: OpenSSH
```

Enhanced output:
```
[+] 192.168.1.1:22 is open
    Service: SSH
    Version: 2.0
    Product: OpenSSH
    OS: Debian
    Extra: compression=zlib@openssh.com
    Vulnerabilities:
      - CVE-2016-6210: User enumeration vulnerability
```

## Performance Considerations

### Enhanced Detection Impact
- Increased buffer size (2048 bytes)
- Additional pattern matching
- Vulnerability scanning overhead
- Longer processing time per service

### Optimization Strategies
- Parallel processing
- Efficient pattern matching
- Smart timeout handling
- Resource management

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. More protocol support
2. Additional vulnerability patterns
3. Custom pattern support
4. Machine learning for service detection
5. Automated exploit suggestions

### Integration Possibilities
- Vulnerability databases
- Exploit frameworks
- Reporting tools
- SIEM systems
